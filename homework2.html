<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Image 1</h2>

  <img src="homework2/image1.jpg" width="80%">
    <p>I actually had a lot of fun capturing and editing this image and the process was almost the same as the first image once I really got the hang of editing and working with photoshop through LinkedIn Learning. The first part in this process was the same as image number two, I was walking though the skybridge that connected the east building and the baker building at around eight oâ€™clock and just looking at Lexington. However, I did not want to capture Lexington Ave twice for my project, instead I turned in the direction of the Thomas Hunter building and noticed the geometrical shape of the north building which was right behind it and was immediately intrigued. My partner and I had about 2 minutes left to get to class so I quickly captured it with a 1/30 shutter speed. I began the editing process and this image has about 7 adjustment layers. The first layer being one of my favorites is the blue gradient which can be seen at the bottom of the image, the original color was just a dark shadow and I wanted to incorporate it with my next adjustment layer. The second tonal adjustment layer was to adjust the range of the image to make it a tad bit brighter and for my third layer I used selective coloring for the shading on the windows and stains left on the vents to make them more blue and stand out to highlight the geometric shape. Lastly, for my fourth layer I used selective coloring again but this time I highlighted the yellows, reds and oranges of my image and added more saturation to make them truly pop and therefore adding highlights and less uniformity to an image that started off dim and dull.</p>
