<h1>Image 2</h1>

<img src="homework2/image2.jpg" width="80%">
    <p>My time creating and editing this image was not the easiest. Taking the image in and of itself was the easiest part for me. I saw something beautiful and did not think twice about capturing it. This image was taken on the skybridge between the east building and the baker building at around eight oâ€™clock, the lights and architecture on this walkway never ceases to amaze me. I set the shutter speed to 1/40 to be able to capture the moving lights of the cars and allow more light into the image but yet capture the stillness of the buildings and trees surrounding Lexington. As for editing, this is where things began to get a bit tricky for me. At first I had used lightroom to see the editing direction I wanted to move forward with, I really played around with a lot of different presets and filters until I settled on one. Moving on, I inserted the original JPEG image into Adobe Photoshop and created multiple layers so as not to destroy/ tamper with the original image. I used selective coloring for both image one and image 2. For image 2 however, I created a layer and strictly used selective coloring for the reds in the image which altered the car lights to make them a yellow/ light orange color. Next, I used levels and selective coloring again and I altered the sky to give it a neutral and almost beige color to make it look almost dreamy. Other layers I created to adjust the tonal arrangement of my image was adding more saturation to the windows on the glass buildings and windows.</p>
