  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>For me, to take a picture means to capture something, a moment, a lapse in time and to immortalize it; it does not need to be beautiful or an extraordinary piece of work to revolutionize the world, it just needs to simply be and that is good enough for me. I began reading “In Plato’s Cave” by Susan Sontang with the understanding that this was written in the 1970’s so this was a very different reality that Susan was living than the one I, as the reader, am currently in. The ongoing circumstances occurring within the confines of the 1970s was that it was not only riddled with ongoing war, the war in Vietnam to be specific. But, this was also a time before smart phones, advanced technology, social media and many other technological entities that are a part of many people's daily lives today whether they want to admit it or not. 
          
<p>Susan Sontang starts off this chapter by illustrating the fact that “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” To me this means that once you take a picture, you are visually representing what is directly in front of you and giving it context. Although images' meanings can get skewed, altered or even at times overly saturated; What remains true is that the image in front of you cannot be denied as it is undeniable proof that what is on your screen, newspaper or any other form of media, is real. The camera is simply an object, it has no human traits, the camera does not lie, it does not spread propaganda and it does not take a stance on anything; All it does is simply provide evidence of what is directly in front of it. It is ultimately up to the photographer to decide what they want their image to be used for, either as a weapon of good or evil.</p>
          
<p>With this being said, photography can be used to represent a multitude of things, most notably the state of the world that exists today, yesterday or decades ago. Susan Sontang writes about the Vietnam War and how although photography is non-interventional that “Part of the horror of such memorable coups of contemporary photojournalism as the pictures of a Vietnamese bonze reaching for the gasoline can, of a Bengali guerrilla in the act of bayoneting a trussed‐up collaborator, comes from the awareness of how plausible it has become, in situations where the photographer has the choice between a photograph and a life, to choose the photograph. The person who intervenes cannot record; the person who is recording cannot intervene.” So while we can represent things like the horrors of what our government unleashes upon the people who are hundreds of thousands of miles away from us, it might come at a cost; A cost to self, a cost to humanity and a cost to those in front of you.</p> 
  
<p> However, Sotang also notes that “Photographs like the one that made the front page of most newspapers in the world in 1972 – a naked South Vietnamese child just sprayed by American napalm, running down a highway toward the camera, her arms open, screaming with pain – probably did more to increase the public revulsion against the war than a hundred hours of televised barbarities.” Images hold power and can be used to end wars and show the public who are living in a naive bubble that nothing bad is going on that there are in fact atrocities occuring; It may not be occuring in your neighborhood, it might not even be in your country, but it is happening. In todays world representation through photography might look like a journalist on the strip of Gaza photographing the active genocide occuring in the state of Palestine or a photographer illustrating the effects of homelessness. These are things that are not occurring directly in front of most of our faces but through photography we become aware of what may have been hidden from us and get to do something about it now.</p>
