  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>RFor this project I wanted to create a geometrical building that is pleasing to the eye so I went to unsplash to download a raster image and found a picture of a building and locked it to my art board. However, first and most importantly, I used the Adobe color wheel to create a triad of colors for me to use within my artboard. The colors that I used were, #8F92A6 a purple hue, #FFFFFF which is simply just white and #9EB0A4 which is almost a sage green hue. I wanted to base my illustration based off of the reflections of the buildings so in order to achieve this I created a gradient from #9EB0A4 to #8F92A6 so from green at the bottom to purple. This not only illustrates reflection but lights as well, the world is complex and things are not just one color. As a matter of fact, even in the original picture every window was a different hue from one another so I also wanted each gradient to be slightly different from one another as was the original. I implemented white very strategically only highlighting the shapes that were already there, I used the line shaping, the square shaping and lowered the opacity as well to make the original picture visible still to create a 3D effect throughout the image. I also wanted to use every effect I could so I used the mirror effect to make it look like the corner of a building as opposed to displaying only one side.</p>
