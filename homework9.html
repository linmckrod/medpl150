<p>For this assignment I created a google forms sheet and posted it on my instagram story and got a surprising amount of responses totaling up to 47, I asked a lot of questions because I was honestly just being a bit nosey but I also was genuinely intrigued on how people's dating lives are in my age group. I asked questions like “are you satisfied with your relationship status … why or why not” and got some pretty depressing answers. I also asked what people were looking for romantically and what the most common issues people faced (the most common was different expectations). However, the ones that I incorporated into my graph were gender, relationship status, how many people they dated and where they met them. I did this because frankly I cant put an open ended question in a graph. I might lose my mind if I did that. I really liked this assignment though, not just because I get to fulfill my dreams of being nosey and learning new information but because it’s just genuinely interesting hearing different perspectives on why or why not their relationships and love life is successful or not. One of the most interesting answers I got was from a girl who said that my test made her want to break up with her boyfriend, which I loved because she realized that he wasn't treating her right and they were heading in opposite directions. I like that I was able to provide some clarity for people just by asking a couple questions and being nosey. I hope she’s doing alright. </p>
