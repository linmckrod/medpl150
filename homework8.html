  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>For this project, I decided I wanted to be simplistic yet creative and colorful at the same time. For the first part of the project I decided I wanted the eye to be monochromatic and differ from the eye in the demo by changing the color and adding a bit more frames to it. In total there were about 20 frames and I still want to add some more to make it look more realistic as well. I had a lot of fun with gradients as well for both the first and second part of the project, adding a gradient to both the lids as well as the iris created a level of shine that separates each part of the eye from one another as well. For the second part of the project I will admit that I struggled a lot with this, it took me a while to get the hang of using the puppet warp tool and I still need to get used to it. Moreover, I took a picture of my best friend Mahmoud from a photoshoot he did for the brand “Who Hurt You?”. The rose he was holding gave me inspiration for how I wanted to warp this image. I had to do this several times because I fear I am a perfectionist and still don’t think the gif is as perfect as I’d like it to be, but I created about 40 frames to make his arm move smoothly to make it seem as if he is handing the rose to you.</p>
