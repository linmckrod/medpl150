  <h1>Reading Reflection 3</h1>
  <h2>"Motherhood in Crisis" by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera</h2>
<p>I read “Memunatu: The distant patient ‘Birth in my village’” and it was painful to read because I know that this is not just one woman's reality but hundreds of thousands, however I am also glad and appreciative that this story is being told because it sheds light on something that many might be afraid to talk about because of the stigmas around women's bodies and childbirth. This story was told through multiple elements of art and design including text, illustration, photography and video and the juxtaposition of all four of these elements creates a masterpiece of a story that becomes engraved in the mind of the reader. This story is designed like a comic book, it uses illustrations and text that emulate something you'd read in a marvel or DC comic and the transitions to real pictures and videos of Memunatu, her baby, other women in the confine and doctors. I believe that this story was told this way because comic books always tell a story and that is exactly what Memunatu is doing; However, this is not just any story, this is Memunatu and many women around the world's reality and the reason why the story later transitions to using pictures and videos from Memunatu’s experience. This shift is created to let the reader know that this is real and happens almost everyday and that we need to protect women who are pregnant, especially black women.</p>
