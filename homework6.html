  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For this exercise, I wanted to convey the emotion of sadness and the simplest way to achieve that was with a tear. I used 2 different shapes and 2 sets of complimentary colors. The first shape I used was a circle and I used it 4 times, once for the iris, another for the pupil and the last two for the shine on the pupil itself. The second shape I used was a square and I used it to create a chart of every color used within my illustration. Furthermore, I also implemented multiple line styles within my design. For instance, I used line style to create eyelashes and the actual eye itself. For the eyelashes, I used the paint brush and set it to basic chisel and to create the actual shine within the eye and within the tear. In order to create the tear, the eye and eyeliner, I used the pencil setting and using the auto-close path setting really helped to develop the shape of everything. I used the gradient tool a lot within this project and helped bring the design to life. The things we see in everyday life are not just one color there are usually layers of colors and that is what I wanted to depict by using the gradient so I implemented it within the iris to create a hazel eye effect, within the eye itself to create a shadow and in the tear ducts to create depth within the eye. I also used it in the tear to create shine and within the shine lines themselves as well.</p>
