<h3>Reflection:</h3>
   <p>For the first part of project 3, I chose to use the same object to represent each depth of field in order to highlight each difference between the deep depth of field, the shallow depth of field and the blurred background, making sure the object was able to stand out from its backgroud of course. My choice to use a Poppi can was completely arbitrary. However, I am glad I thought of this last minute as each picture was able to highlight a prominent difference. The shallow depth of field, which was taken with the highest possible aperture, looked as if the entire image was blurry because it was. Because the camera was at the highest aperture, it allowed more light in and this will cause the subject to appear blurry in some instances. The image with the deeper depth of field was taken with the lowest possible aperture and because of this, my partner and I had to adjust the settings to maneuver around the fact that when the aperture is low, so it the lighting. Once you set the aperture to the lowest setting, it actually has the opposite effect and drowns light out so we had adjust the shutter speed to let in more light. Once this was achieved, you can see the difference between the deep depth of field and the shallow depth of field as the deep DoP had a clear background whereas the shallow was blurry. Lastly, with the blur background, I just inserted a raw file into photoshop and blurred the background around the subject until it was satisfactory.</p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3>
   <p>For part two of this project, I decided to incorporate different parts of the school this time, I took the first image and my partner Neffertti took the second. I would say the first image was one of the more difficult ones to edit and be creative with as I struggled to figure out how exactly I wanted to see this image edited artistically. I started out by adding the denoise feature for every image in this project to make my images more clear. Then, I used the straighten tools for the first image and leveled the image horizontally in order to still have the image still being directed to a focal point without the image being as slanted as it was before. Next, I used the histogram and clipping warnings to get rid of the over-exposed parts of my image and used a filter on top to maintain an aesthetic feel to it. For image 2, I first had to use the heal feature in order to get rid of distracting aspects like reflections and signs throughout the school. After I did this, I used the denoise feature as stated before to make the image more clear and added luminosity as well as sharpening and clarity for the same purpose. Furthermore, I used the straightening tool by drawing 4 reference lines around the perimeter of the rows of images and this is how I straightened my image. Lastly, I again used both the clipping warnings and the histogram in order to fix the over-exposed as well as under-exposed parts of the image and placed a filter on-top to create a conematic and moody feel.</p>
