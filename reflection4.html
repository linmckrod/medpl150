  <h2>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times.</h2>
<p>In “The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It,” W. J. Hennigan lays out the fact that nuclear war is not as far as we might think and it is, as a matter of fact, already happening. The beginning of this article starts off with a very intriguing and attention grabbing introduction, The very beginning of this article starts off with a red gradient website that flashes in and out and has white text. As you continue to scroll, aspects begin to change. You can see that the red sometimes gets darker and other times the red begins to get brighter and the font even begins to change as well. The font also gets bigger at times and once you get to the end of the introduction into the article and continue to scroll, the red then gets brighter and brighter and the font also begins to get bigger and bigger which in turn is imitating an action explosion. This is the entire topic of this article which covers nuclear war, its effects and what a person with a sheltered life might not see, especially if they do not keep up with current events and choose not to “partake” in politics and current affairs because they believe that it does not affect them. I believe that by doing this you are reeling people in and creating a place to inform people on the current state of the world if they are not already aware.</p>
<p>I also kept thinking about how small conflicts can grow into something much bigger and the longer things are swept under the rug or the longer we do not speak up for people who need us to speak up for them then it will become increasingly easier for situations like this to persist. Take the Palestinian genocide for instance; Hennigan writes how “Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza, has amassed enough enriched uranium to build several weapons if and when it chooses.” And it is our tax dollars that are funding such atrocious acts. This is not normal and many people think that because it is not happening to them, that we do not need to pay attention to the situation at hand and spread awareness for Palestinians and all who are being oppressed, but we do, we always do.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hennigan also writes how situations in places like Ukraine or tensions on the Korean Peninsula aren’t just local issues. They have the potential to pull powerful countries into dangerous situations. Even nations without nuclear weapons are watching and planning for what might happen next. The world is way more connected than you might notice.</p>
