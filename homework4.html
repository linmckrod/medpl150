  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my first collage I am titling it “Fight Back”. It features students protesting In New York City for the lives of Palestinians, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide and calling for a ceasefire. This topic is extremely important to me and I wanted to demonstrate that through this collage. This collage also features a powerful image of a Palestinian man waving his flag in Gaza as well as a sign that states “fuck war, fuck weapons, fuck systems” and lastly an upside down image of the capitol building. The techniques I used to achieve the results I did were a bit arbitrary because I did a lot of experimenting. First I tried to separate the backgrounds from the subjects, but because these were complex images I had a lot of subtracting from mask to do for every image. Next I wanted my image to be in black and white so I first played with hue,saturation and brightness but I liked how the image looked most when I just used the black and white adjustment layer instead. Lastly, I had the most fun working with filters, I wanted to create a newspaper effect so I used texturize for everything. I got all of my images from Unsplash.</p>
