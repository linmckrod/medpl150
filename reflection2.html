  <h2>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik</h2>
  <p>AI is dangerous. Unfortunately I myself never knew the extent of the consequences AI has until I witnessed, not only was it ruining people's individuality, integrity, safety as well as their discernment, but also ruining the environment, peoples lives, entire ecosystems and neighborhoods. AI is polluting and drying lakes and oceans. Data centers around the US are exerting power and water at the expense of smaller communities, running up their electricity bill while simultaneously stealing and polluting their water.</p>
  <p>I and many others were ignorantly under the impression that AI could be used to help with material such as medical and technological advancements or matters such as studying and so on and so forth. However, as I learned more about AI, I noticed it actually does not help at all, it makes you dependent upon it to the point where you are using it for tasks you can easily do yourself which is why we are seeing an epidemic of learning. People are using AI to curate grocery and to-do lists, content ideas, text messages and even using it as a therapist or chat-bot for mundane topics and issues. A bigger issue is that it also creates less opportunity for artistry, when big names like Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj use AI to promote her work as opposed to hiring graphic designers, you are pushing out real artists and that is a big problem. There is beauty in the struggle to create or write something yourself and everyone should understand that.</p>
  <p>As Nesrine Malik so carefully points out, AI is now being weaponized. We are seeing political leaders use it to push agendas, men using it to create revenge porn and harassing women, it is even being used to scam people. I have seen first hand and been a victim to men using AI to render images of me and spread them around the internet. As I said before, AI is dangerous and there are no regulations on it which will only make things worse. Older generations are extremely susceptible to AI as well hence the title of the article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” Older generations of people are seeing and engaging with AI videos thinking they are real and spreading them across countless platforms such as whatsapp. Most of us have family members who send us AI videos and you have to tell them that it is fake and this is unfortunately becoming a universal experience. It is becoming dangerously clear that AI can easily target people.</p>
  <p>However, I don’t know what’s worse, AI being used to target marginalized communities or the fact that our own government is promoting blatant racism towards black and hispanic americans with AI. Below I have attached several links to the White House's official twitter account using AI generated images to push a racist agenda. This did not begin at the start of Trump’s presidency, during the 2024 presidential campaign there was an uproar of racist AI generated images and videos of Kamala Harris circulating the internet. Moreover, AI was and still is being used to demonize the people of Palestine as well as the people who stand up and protest for Gaza. My question is, will we ever see any pushback and regulation on the uses of AI? How much damage has to be caused first before we see any real action towards the regulation of AI? Or will we not see any because our political leaders are too busy having fun asking chatGPT to generate cartoon images of Donald Trump standing next to alligators wearing ICE hats?</p>
