  <h1>Reading Reflection 3</h1>
  <h2>"Motherhood in Crisis" by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera</h2>
<p>I read “Memunatu: The distant patient ‘Birth in my village’” and it was painful to read because I know that this is not just one woman's reality but hundreds of thousands, however I am also glad and appreciative that this story is being told because it sheds light on something that many might be afraid to talk about because of the stigmas around women's bodies and childbirth. This story was told through multiple elements of art and design including text, illustration, photography and video and the juxtaposition of all four of these elements creates a masterpiece of a story that becomes engraved in the mind of the reader. This story is designed like a comic book, it uses illustrations and text that emulate something you'd read in a marvel or DC comic and the transitions to real pictures and videos of Memunatu, her baby, other women in the confine and doctors. I believe that this story was told this way because comic books always tell a story and that is exactly what Memunatu is doing; However, this is not just any story, this is Memunatu and many women around the world's reality and the reason why the story later transitions to using pictures and videos from Memunatu’s experience. This shift is created to let the reader know that this is real and happens almost everyday and that we need to protect women who are pregnant, especially black women.</p>
<p>Moreover, the illustrations vary from the photography within this story through size and design itself. The illustrations themselves vary but they are all the same size and create uniformity, however when the pictures and videos start being introduced within the story they take up most of the screen and I believe this choice was purposeful to not only keep the reader engaged but to pull the reader into reality and show that this is not a mere comic but rather ​​Memunatu’s and many other women alike’s real life experience. Memunatu specifically shows pictures of the confine, her home, the doctors who helped her and Memunatu with her baby. Memunatu with her baby especially stood out to me because not only does it show how the proper care was finally given to her but gives the story a resolution. In the beginning of this story Memunatu was not given the proper care and treatment she needed and because of that she lost her child and sustained multiple illnesses because of this so when the reader sees a picture of Memunatu happy and healthy with her baby at the end of her story we see that something can be done to help women everywhere. Unfortunately readers are not always engaged in text only stories and others might feel detached from a picture only story so the way that Memunatu’s story is told creates an advantage that might not have been present if this story were simply a text or picture only story because all three elements combined together create a feeling within the reader that would only occur if we got to see this tale come to life the way that it did.</p>
