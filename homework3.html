<h3>Reflection:</h3>
   <p>For the first part of project 3, I chose to use the same object to represent each depth of field in order to highlight each difference between the deep depth of field, the shallow depth of field and the blurred background, making sure the object was able to stand out from its backgroud of course. My choice to use a Poppi can was completely arbitrary. However, I am glad I thought of this last minute as each picture was able to highlight a prominent difference. The shallow depth of field, which was taken with the highest possible aperture, looked as if the entire image was blurry because it was. Because the camera was at the highest aperture, it allowed more light in and this will cause the subject to appear blurry in some instances. The image with the deeper depth of field was taken with the lowest possible aperture and because of this, my partner and I had to adjust the settings to maneuver around the fact that when the aperture is low, so it the lighting. Once you set the aperture to the lowest setting, it actually has the opposite effect and drowns light out so we had adjust the shutter speed to let in more light. Once this was achieved, you can see the difference between the deep depth of field and the shallow depth of field as the deep DoP had a clear background whereas the shallow was blurry. Lastly, with the blur background, I just inserted a raw file into photoshop and blurred the background around the subject until it was satisfactory.</p>
