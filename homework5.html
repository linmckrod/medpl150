<p>This homework assignment was based off of my previous homework assignment. I incorporated 3 repeated circular dotted ovals and they were meant to draw even more attention to the issue at hand which is that Haitians are being displaced and we need to speak up for them because this is a very important issue I feel is not being televised. I used the dotted yellow ovals because it draws direct attention to my main point in this collage. I used the ellipse tool and from there I increased the line points and made them thicker to bring more attention to the ovals themselves and then I made them dotted which I feel brings even more attention to the shapes. I then used smart tools and pixelated the image which makes the image more interesting. </p>
